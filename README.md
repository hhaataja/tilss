Learning project for Firebase DB (https://www.firebase.com/) and KnockoutJS (http://knockoutjs.com/). 
Goal is to create a simple lists manager app which enables multiple users to edit same lists concurrently.
Multiple users should be able to collaborately make changes on a lists and changes to lists 
should be propagated to other users in real time.

For example a shopping lists can be accessed via mobile and any changes made to a list by another user
should be visible in real-time without having to update the list.
